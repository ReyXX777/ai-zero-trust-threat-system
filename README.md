AI-Driven Zero Trust Threat Intelligence System
A cutting-edge Zero Trust architecture integrated with AI-driven threat intelligence to enhance cybersecurity using behavioral analysis and heuristic detection.
Overview
The AI-Driven Zero Trust Threat Intelligence System is a comprehensive platform designed to secure modern infrastructures by leveraging:

Zero Trust Architecture: Always verify, never trust.
AI/ML Models: Detect anomalous user and entity behavior.
Heuristic Analysis: Identify malicious activity based on heuristic rules.
Real-Time Threat Detection: Analyze, detect, and respond to potential threats in real-time.
This system is built using Rust for backend services and Svelte with WebAssembly for the frontend, ensuring high performance and security across all components.

Tech Stack
Backend:
Rust: Fast, secure, and safe.
Actix-Web: Web framework for building APIs.
Tch-rs (PyTorch): Machine learning library for Rust.
Polars: High-performance DataFrames for Rust.
PostgreSQL: For relational data storage.
Frontend:
Svelte: Reactive web framework with no virtual DOM.
Rust WebAssembly: For performance-intensive data processing in the browser.
Infrastructure:
Docker: Containerization of services.
Kafka: Real-time data streaming.
Zeek: Network traffic analyzer for monitoring.
ELK Stack: Logging and monitoring.
Istio: Zero Trust service mesh for securing communications.
Features
Behavioral Analysis: Uses AI to analyze user and network behavior, detecting anomalies in real-time.
Heuristic-Based Detection: Identifies potential threats based on predefined heuristic rules and patterns.
Zero Trust Security: Implements micro-segmentation, continuous verification, and least-privilege access.
Real-Time Threat Dashboard: Visualizes security threats and behavioral anomalies in real-time.
AI/ML-Driven Insights: Custom machine learning models built in Rust (Tch-rs) to enhance threat detection accuracy.
Usage
Once the services are up and running, you can access the dashboard at:

http://localhost:5000 (or wherever your frontend is hosted).

Threat Detection API:
POST /api/detect_threats:
Payload: { "type": "malware" }
Response: { "threat_score": 0.9 }
Behavioral Analysis API:
GET /api/behavioral_analysis:
Response: Behavioral analysis results from the AI/ML model.
